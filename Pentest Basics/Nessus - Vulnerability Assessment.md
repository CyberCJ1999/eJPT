## Nessus - Vulnerability Assessment
- Scan of the vulnerabilities found on networks and applications ; faster + lighter load on the infrastructure
- Do not proceed with the exploitation phase
- Confirm the vulnerabilities by testing them + give proof of existence

**Vulnerability Scanner**
Scanners use a database of known vulnerabilities + security audits to detect vulnerabilities. Scanners perform their probes on:
- Daemons listening on TCP/UDP ports
- Config files of OS, software, network devices
- Windows registry entries

**Nessus**
Architecture
- 2 components: client + server
- Client: configure the scans 
- Server: perform the scanning processes + report results back to client

- Client: provides web interface to configure the scans
- Server: performs the scans by sending probes to systems + applications, collecting responses + matching against vulnerability database

**Port Scanning**
- Target hosts are alive + which ports are open
- Perform port scan; more accurate the port scan is = useful results the vulnerability scanner will get
- Open port: vulnerability scanner will send special probes = which applications (name + version) is running

**Database Lookup**
- For each detected service (daemon) scanner queries its database looking for known vulnerabilities
- Configure the scanner; scan OS vulnerabilities or web server vulnerabilities
